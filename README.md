# Reinforcement Learning Toolkit üéì

An extensive, easily-referenced Toolkit for reinforcement learning, developed as part of the TAU-23 course.

This repository contains a comprehensive set of reference documents for the course, organized into individual LaTeX files for each main topic. This allows for quick access to specific sections when you need to brush up on a particular topic.

## üìö Contents

The cheat sheet is divided into the following sections:

1. **Recap**: [RECAP.tex](./RECAP.tex)
2. **Discrete Dynamic Systems**: [Discrete_Dynamic_Systems.tex](./Discrete_Dynamic_Systems.tex)
3. **DDP - Finite Horizon**: [DDP_-_Finite_Horizon.tex](./DDP_-_Finite_Horizon.tex)
4. **DDP - Average Cost**: [DDP_-_Average_cost.tex](./DDP_-_Average_cost.tex)
5. **MDP**: [MDP.tex](./MDP.tex)
6. **Contraction Operators**: [Contraction_Operators.tex](./Contraction_Operators.tex)
7. **Model Based - Off Policy**: [Model_Based_--_Off_policy.tex](./Model_Based_--_Off_policy.tex)
8. **Model Based - On Policy**: [Model_Based_-_On_policy.tex](./Model_Based_-_On_policy.tex)
9. **Homework**: [Homework.tex](./Homework.tex)

A comprehensive file ([main.tex](./main.tex)) is also included, which compiles all the above sections into a single, seamless document.
